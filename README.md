# mobile-app-development-portfolio1
This is a portfolio assignment from Mobile App Development! Testing what I learned in the class so far and how did I apply it here!

# Here are the changes that I have done for this portfolio assignment!

This work was done previous in Lab 4, in which I had to use React and JavaScript to create a "menu".

I have added the Breakfast and Lunch sections to create a three-course menu. 

I have also added some CSS when creating the title of the menu "The Food Club" and also a slogan that makes it stand out!

The work to create these sections are is in the App.js file.
